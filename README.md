    The robot trajectory dataset is generated by the real seven-DOF robot named Franka Emika Panda with structural parameters recorded in [1]. The manipulator is given a rose curve path tracking task within 20 s. As a result, a dataset consisting of seven joint velocities of the robot is included, which are made up of 20,000 units taking 1 ms as the sampling period.
